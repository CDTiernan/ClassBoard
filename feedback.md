# Project One: Profile

## Overall:

You did not include the authors for the individual sections (vision, features, team) so I have no idea who wrote this. Where is your logo? You need to have one embedded in the documentation. Also, you need to be aware when you don’t have multiple sections structured different ways. If you look at the bio, the structure changes from each bio. So you need to come up with a unifying structure that makes all the bios look the same. This will make the profile look much better. Also, where is your slogan?

## Idea:


I love that you split this up into two separate parts, an overall idea and then the features. As a consumer, I can see the pitch and then how you are going to build it. I also really liked the wording in “the Vision”. Using examples made it really easy to see how this was going to work. However, there is a difference between the idea discussed in the profile and the idea described in the ReadMe. Which idea are you guys going to work on? TeamUp or ClassroomBlackboard?

## Bios:

I liked your bios, but I would have liked to hear a little bit more about your life outside of CS. Tell me what you are interested in outside of school. I know you are interested in computer science, but what else drives you? I think one more pass at your bios keeping this in mind will make the profiles much better.


**Overall grade: Thumbs down. Please rewrite with my edits and I will revise your grade.**




#Project One: Profile (revision)

## Overall:

You should still include when each section was updated most recently. This document will change and evolve throughout the course, so you are going to want to provide when the most recent revision was made.

## Idea:

Thanks for clarifying which idea you are planning on using!

## Bios:

Good work with your revision! You now have a really good structure that all of your bios are applied to and I like that you have those two different sections, one that describes your compsci skills and one that describes your interests outside of compsci.

**Overall grade: Strong thumbs up! Good work!**




#Project Two

##Overall:

The structure is good and it has everything it needs to have. However, you do want to clarify the last time this was updated.

##Bios:

Good! It looks just like the profile bios, which were really good following the second revision.

##Problem Statement:

This is really interesting and useful, but you really should mention two explicit classes and how your experience in them shaped this problem.

##Product Description:

Looks fantastic! I have no problem with this!

##Timeline:

This timeline is really ambitious. Make sure to consistently update this as the class goes on and mention whatever roadblocks you run into.

##Budget:

Good. You've done your homework on what would be good for a server, etc. Although, you might be able to go into what *explicitly* you are going to use the advertising for.

**Overall grade: Thumbs up! Great work, guys!**

#Project Three

##Overall:

You do not include a pdf version of the fspec document or include the images within the fspec. These are vital. When you describe each individual view, I want to be able to see it and see exactly what you are talking about. It was explicitly mentioned in the requirements for the project to have the views embedded into the document. Also, the Use Cases needed to be different. They aren't just lists of individual components but actual *stories* with actual names of users and so on. Take a look at the example texts.

##Idea:

Good. I have nothing to add or say here.

##Views

Again, I need to have the images. There are also some minor grammatical mistakes. Not that big of a deal, but you guys might want to read it out loud to make sure everything sounds good.

##Integrative Experience

Good. But capitalize "introductory biology".

##Use Cases

Another major problem. Again, these are stories not just descriptions of components. You have to revise this so that they resemble the stories described in previous examples.

##Non Goals

Again, take a look at previous versions. A bulleted list is not okay. You want to go through the explicit non-goals so that I can understand them. Most of these are jokes and I find them funny, but what you might want to do is have a pargraph where you go through the explicit non-goals (such as Wolphram Alpha integration) and then at the end of that paragraph say, "Here are some other goals we don't plan on meeting: global cooling, etc.". Just a suggestion.

**Overall grade: Thumbs down! Revise within two days and I'll change your grade.**
