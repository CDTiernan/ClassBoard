OB# Project One: Profile

## Overall:

You did not include the authors for the individual sections (vision, features, team) so I have no idea who wrote this. Where is your logo? You need to have one embedded in the documentation. Also, you need to be aware when you don’t have multiple sections structured different ways. If you look at the bio, the structure changes from each bio. So you need to come up with a unifying structure that makes all the bios look the same. This will make the profile look much better. Also, where is your slogan?

## Idea:


I love that you split this up into two separate parts, an overall idea and then the features. As a consumer, I can see the pitch and then how you are going to build it. I also really liked the wording in “the Vision”. Using examples made it really easy to see how this was going to work. However, there is a difference between the idea discussed in the profile and the idea described in the ReadMe. Which idea are you guys going to work on? TeamUp or ClassroomBlackboard?

## Bios:

I liked your bios, but I would have liked to hear a little bit more about your life outside of CS. Tell me what you are interested in outside of school. I know you are interested in computer science, but what else drives you? I think one more pass at your bios keeping this in mind will make the profiles much better.


**Overall grade: Thumbs down. Please rewrite with my edits and I will revise your grade.**
