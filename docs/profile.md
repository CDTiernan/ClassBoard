TeamUp

The Vision
--------------

Writing a paper at your favorite coffee shop? Studying for the big math final at the library? Waiting for people to show up and play basketball? As a college student, life is spent doing your own thing around countless others; but have you ever asked yourself how many of those others are doing the same thing as you?

With TeamUp, it’s easy to view and create activities that people around you can join. In moments, see what’s going on around you; from a game of frisbee with twelve members a quarter-mile away to a four person study group for CmpSci 326 in the basement of the library-- it is all on TeamUp.

Everything that’s going on right now is only a tap away, and the next big thing is yours to create!

### Andrew Gora
Year: Junior
Concentration: General
Languages: Python, Coffeescript, Javascript, Java, Scala
CS: 121, 187, 220, 240, 250
non-CS: American Foreign Policy, Marxian Economics
I am currently a junior at UMass. I am interested in various aspects of computing from AI to game design to data analysis. I have been mesmerized by computers for my entire life, starting with my first brute force endeavor of learning how to navigate the Windows installer before I had learned how to read. By age 13 I was hosting my first website coded in HTML. I love thinking abstractly and coming up with unique approaches to problems.

### Carter Tiernan
Hello, I am a Junior computer science major concentrating in AI here at UMass. Web development is actually what got me into computer science and programming; however, when I was making my first website I had no idea how much more there was to learn in the field. I am very excited to take my understanding even deeper during this course. For the past year I have been working for a company based in Cambridge MA called InterSystems, I work on developing an internal application used for scheduling training courses. During development of this app I have used my company’s object oriented database called Cache to store information about the courses, and Twitter’s Bootstrap to format the application. The functionality of the application is coded heavily in javascript, but in order to access and alter the database I use our in-house coding language called ObjectScript with embedded SQL (and more javascript). I am very excited to build my own web application with my group from the bottom up and learn everything that is needed to set up a functioning web application.

#### Bio

I am a sophomore CS major at UMass Amherst. I came to Umass undeclared and unsure of my future, and fortunately one of my random first semester courses was CS 121.  Almost instantly I knew that this was the subject for me, and I declared my major within a month.  I love challenges, and CS is full of accessible and never ending challenges.  I’m pumped to make a complete web app this semester and be able to use it.  I plan to use this course prepare me for future hackathons as well.

#### Bio

I’m a Junior computer science major at UMass Amherst. I’ve been into computers my whole life, and I think it’s really interesting learning how to actually make programs and apps. I’m very excited about this class as I think we will carry over many of these skills into the real world. My dream is to make a successful app so that I can work for myself and grow my own company… and eventually sell the company for a lot of money, but we’ll see where it goes. Working for other companies would be a lot of fun too, as many of them are working on very interesting projects.
