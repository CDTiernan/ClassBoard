ClassBoard
======
> Bringing the Classroom Together

The Vision
--------------

ClassBoard will be a configurable dashboard for classroom-related widgets. Our goal is to integrate as many classroom interactions as possible into the browser, allowing for a more streamlined and efficient classroom experience. Classrooms will become paperless when using ClassBoard, as it will keep all class documents stored in one place and organized. Other class activities such as splitting the class into groups or giving a timed quiz will also be performed by Classboard. There will be many widgets performing different functionalities, we will only highlight a few in this overview. 

An attendance widget will perform the task of taking attendance, allowing the professor to no longer be concerned about which students will be marked present, as it will be done automatically when each student logs on to their room’s ClassBoard. Handouts will be easier than ever with simple drag and drop file sharing widgets. Students can utilize a widget to post questions to the dashboard that others can view and upvote or comment on. This will allow the professor to focus on answering the questions that the greatest number of students would like answered.

##### Non-Computer Science Courses
>Introduction to Psychology, Marxian Economics

While my main focus at UMass is to learn computer science and get a glimpse into some of its numerous applications, I'm also fascinated by people. The courses I've taken outside of the computer science major have mostly been socially themed. I enjoy learning about how people behave and feel and how these things are affected by one's environment. I've learned from Introduction to Psychology that people can be intimidated by asking questions when they get lost in class for fear of how others will perceive them, especially if they assume that everyone else understands it. Taking Marxian Economics helped me realize the importance of doing things as a community. That's why we plan on allowing students to communicate any questions/issues in a low-stress, non disruptive manner. If other people have similar confusion, then it will be easier to solve the issue as a classroom community.  

#### Biography
I am currently a junior at UMass. I am interested in various aspects of computing from AI to game design to data analysis. I have been mesmerized by computers for my entire life, starting with my first brute force endeavor of learning how to navigate the Windows installer before I had learned how to read. Now I am trying to broaden my horizons and learn numerous languages so I can have an entire palette of tools to implement my ideas. I love thinking abstractly and coming up with unique approaches to problems.

##### Non-Computer Science Courses
>Mathematical Finance, Leadership in a Global Community

Although my college career has been focused most heavily in computer science, I have a strong interest in mathematics as well. Furthermore, the two fields are extremely intertwined and I enjoy looking at the connections between the math and computer science courses I have taken. Applied math, such as Mathematical Finance and Game Theory, is of specific interest to me because learning the mathematical equations and rules that describe the world I live in opens countless doors for me to model such activity computationally. From trying to predict which stocks will succeed to how to play an optimal game of chess, learning the mathematics of our world allows me to create better and more accurate computer models to predict the future of the real world.

#### Biography
I am a Junior computer science major concentrating in AI here at UMass. Web development is actually what got me into computer science and programming; however, when I was making my first website I had no idea how much more there was to learn in the field. I am very excited to take my understanding even deeper during this course. For the past year I have been working for a company based in Cambridge MA called InterSystems, I work on developing an internal application used for scheduling training courses. During development of this app I have used my company’s object oriented database called Cache to store information about the courses, and Twitter’s Bootstrap to format the application. The functionality of the application is coded heavily in javascript, but in order to access and alter the database I use our in-house coding language called ObjectScript with embedded SQL (and more javascript). I am very excited to build my own web application with my group from the bottom up and learn everything that is needed to set up a functioning web application.

##### Non-Computer Science Courses
>Introduction to Kinesiology, Introduction to Biology I

In addition to computer science, I’m also very interested in kinesiology and biology.  More specifically, my interest is more focused on mimicking natural biological processes with computers.  Although it sounds difficult, I think it would be intriguing and interesting to work on.  Nature has already created extremely complex machines, so we should see if we can replicate and learn from some of them.

#### Biography
I am a sophomore CS major at UMass Amherst. I came to Umass undeclared and unsure of my future, and fortunately one of my random first semester courses was CS 121.  Almost instantly I knew that this was the subject for me, and I declared my major within a month.  I love challenges, and CS is full of accessible and never ending challenges.  I’m pumped to make a complete web app this semester and be able to use it.  I plan to use this course prepare me for future hackathons as well.

##### Non-Computer Science Courses
> Exploring the Universe, General Physics 1

I have always been interested in Astronomy and Physics. Taking those two courses made me realize that my knowledge with computer science can allow me to design programs in other fields that I am interested in. For example, my astronomy class used an app called Stellarium, which is essentially a planetarium for your computer. Computer Science is such a useful field since every other field needs a computer scientist to develop applications.

#### Biography
I’m a Junior computer science major at UMass Amherst. I’ve been into computers my whole life, and I think it’s really interesting learning how to actually make programs and apps. I’m very excited about this class as I think we will carry over many of these skills into the real world. My dream is to make a successful app so that I can work for myself and grow my own company… and eventually sell the company for a lot of money, but we’ll see where it goes. Working for other companies would be a lot of fun too, as many of them are working on very interesting projects.

##### Non-Computer Science Courses
> Statistics 515, Intro to Psychology

One my favorite things about computer science is that it can be applied to almost any subject, problem or field in order to calculate, automate or improve efficiency. CS is awesome because being able to program naturally enhances your abilities in almost any subject. I am personally very interested in psychology and statistics, and CS definitely enhances my ability to work in these subjects as it gives me the ability to analyze and process huge amounts of data.

#### Biography
I’m a junior computer science major. Ultimately my goal in life is to never have to work for someone ever again. I’m really interested in business and would hopefully like to start my own one day. I am pretty much always working on some personal programming project in my spare time with the hopes that one may turn into a business. I have made two mobile app games so far, Dumb Balloons and Swapify, both of which are on iOS and Android. My latest project is a web app called Zesty which is an attempt to make a better version of Reddit.com, I am excited to take this course so that I can hopefully learn some new tricks.
