Timmy Jones is a computer science student at University of Massachusetts Amherst. He enjoys playing video games and long walks on the beach, but is not fond of large groups of people, as he is very shy. Normally if Timmy gets confused in a lecture, he will just resign himself to being lost for the rest of the class because he is too embarrassed to raise his hand and admit he’s confused. With Classboard, Timmy can let the teacher know he’s confused anonymously, avoiding any anxiety about what his peers may think.

Tanya Pickles is an instructor at University of Narnia. She wants to bring her lectures up to date with modern technology, but she's always worried about getting her identity stolen. As a precaution, she always uses a different password for every website she makes an account on. The problem with this is that there are too many different websites for her to keep track of for functionality such as recording grades, taking attendance, giving quizzes, and other tasks she would like to perform. Because Classboard centralizes these things, she only has to remember a single password: the one for her Classboard account. 

Classboard is intended to be a web-based app for use on laptops. As such, we do not plan on implementing any sort of layout changes or optimization for mobile browsers. Our app will not involve any integration with social media such as facebook logins, as the main prerequisite for making an account is to have a .edu email address. We won't be supporting third party widgets because we don't want to allow the creation of widgets that could be detrimental to learning, such as a Wolfram Alpha widget that would facilitate students getting answers without solving problems themselves. We will not have pages for user profiles, nor any sort of machine learning.

Other things outside the scope of our app include: 
-An offensive chat bot
-A self destruct button that downloads a virus and deletes every file on your computer
-A fully function Civilization V widget
-A complete mapping of the human brain
-Global cooling
-World peace
-Advanced flowchart functionality for graphing life happiness
