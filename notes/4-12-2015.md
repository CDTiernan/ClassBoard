####Date and Time:

* Date: 4/12/2015
* Time: 10:15pm - 10:45pm


####Participants:

* Andrew Gora
* Matt McNally
* Austin Sheppard


####Discussion Points:

* What UI framework should we use?
    * we'll be using Angular.js, since we need to update view without reloading, especially for the dashboard view, and angular add strong features for changing view without reloading.
    * Mean.js is also integrated with Angular.js to begin with, so we'll have a bit of sample code to work with

* What database should we use?
    * Since Mean.js has angular already integrated, we will be using mean for our starter code. Since mean also has database integration with MongoDB to some degree, it makes sense to use MongoDB as our database

* We still need to get a better grip on Mean.js, and makes sure that all team members can run the project (at this point both andrew and carter have issues running the Mean.js starter code)


####Tasks Assigned:

* meet tomorrow if possible to get some stuff done with the app, probably sign in and sign up things to begin with, then moving into the beginnings of the dashboard
* also meet tuesday and continue working
